# TensorRT_PROJECT_USE

This repository is used to generate a TRT engine for a pre-trained onnx model. Before running the program, you need to put the following files in the correct folder:

- Put [ONNX model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15UrYNYWFs6hQTqUC35F8lSDS_AME0dFb/view?usp=sharing) in `weights` folder
- Put [input_matrix](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16O9UMX337KFZj-db9XlEXIcmeqxDU8lq/view?usp=sharing) in `data` folder
